                <div class="article-meta">October 25, 2023 | By William Thompson</div>
                <img src="../images/shaoxing-ancient-town.svg" alt="Shaoxing Ancient Town" class="hero-image">
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Shaoxing, often overlooked by international travelers, is one of China's most historically significant cities with over 2,500 years of rich cultural heritage. Once the capital of the ancient Yue Kingdom, this enchanting water town in Zhejiang Province has nurtured some of China's most celebrated literary figures, including Lu Xun, Wang Xizhi, and Cai Yuanpei. With its network of canals, distinctive black-awning boats, and well-preserved ancient architecture, Shaoxing offers visitors an authentic glimpse into traditional Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) culture. Here's a carefully crafted two-day itinerary to help you discover the best this literary city has to offer.</p>
                
                <h2>Day One: Literary Heritage and Romantic Tales</h2>
                
                <h3>Morning: Lu Xun's Former Residence</h3>
                <p>Begin your Shaoxing adventure around 8:00 AM at <strong>Lu Xun's Former Residence</strong>, the childhood home of China's most influential modern writer. This well-preserved complex includes several interconnected courtyards and buildings where Lu Xun (born Zhou Shuren) spent his formative years. The site encompasses the Old and New Family Houses, Hundred Herbs Garden, Three-Flavor Study Room, and the Lu Xun Memorial Hall.</p>
                
                <p>Pay special attention to the <strong>Three-Flavor Study Room</strong> (San Wei Shu Wu), the private school where young Lu Xun received his classical education. The room maintains its original furnishings, including the large character for "early" hanging on the wall—a reminder for students to rise early for their studies. This location inspired Lu Xun's famous essay "From the Hundred Herbs Garden to the Three-Flavor Study Room," offering insights into traditional Chinese education.</p>
                
                <p>While in the area, don't miss the opportunity to take a short ride on a traditional <strong>black-awning boat</strong> (wupeng chuan). These distinctive vessels have been Shaoxing's primary mode of water transportation for centuries. As your boatman poles through the narrow waterways, you'll gain a unique perspective of the ancient water town architecture and daily life along the canals.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <h4>Traveler's Tip</h4>
                    <p>Lu Xun's Former Residence is free to visit, but requires advance reservation through the "Shaoxing Tourism" WeChat official account. Arriving early in the morning helps you avoid tour groups and provides a more contemplative atmosphere to appreciate the historical significance of the site.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Lunch: Authentic Shaoxing Cuisine</h3>
                <p>For lunch, head to <strong>Xunbao Ji Shaoxing Restaurant</strong> (on Lu Xun Road), a local establishment serving traditional Shaoxing dishes in an elegant setting. The menu features several specialties worth trying:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yellow Wine Drunken Chicken</strong> (huang jiu zui ji): Tender chicken marinated in Shaoxing's famous yellow rice wine, creating a delicate flavor with subtle wine aromatics</li>
                    <li><strong>Yellow Wine Zongzi</strong>: Glutinous rice dumplings infused with Shaoxing wine, offering a unique twist on this traditional food</li>
                    <li><strong>Stinky Tofu</strong> (chou doufu): Shaoxing's version is less pungent than other regional varieties, with a crispy exterior and soft interior</li>

                        <p>This is an excellent guide! I followed this itinerary last month and had a wonderful experience. Lu Xun's Former Residence and Shen Garden were particularly moving—it felt like stepping back in time. I'd also recommend adding East Lake Scenic Area to your itinerary if you have extra time; the lake views are stunning.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for this detailed guide! I tried the Yellow Wine Drunken Chicken at Xunbao Ji as recommended and it was delicious. One important note for visitors: Lu Xun's Former Residence now requires reservations at least one day in advance, not same-day. Also, Cangqiao Straight Street is absolutely magical at night—perfect for photography!</p>
